# Figma token table generator

Based on the format `<Light/Dark>/<Colour Role>/<Colour State>/<Modifier>`  this plugin will generate a labelled table of all the swatches.

It's handy to visualise what tokens you have, which are missing and which are possibly misaligned.

E.g. Look at all your Warning tokens for the different roles like Text, Icon, Surface, etc.

Token format follows the Shopify Polaris design system with some modifications.
